                        <p>Regardless of what libraries are in your stack, I want to emphasize that everything in the above
                            list can be accomplished today with a little work. There are caveats however.</p>
                        <p><b>We know the mobile web is <a href="#">slow</a>.</b></p>
                        <p>The web has evolved from a document-centric platform to a first-class application platform. At the same time the bulk of our computing has moved from powerful desktop machines with fast, reliable network connections to relatively underpowered mobile devices with connections that are often <i>slow, flaky or both</i>. This is especially true in parts of the world where the next billion users are coming online. To unlock a faster mobile web:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

Lighthouse emulates a Nexus 5X with touch events,
                                viewport emulation and a throttled network connection (150ms latency, 1.6Mbps throughput).</li>

                                seconds on a representative device so more of that budget for our app code is ❤

                            theme colors. Btw, there’s a Totally Tooling Tips episode on Web App Manifests if interested

                            Installed web app will launch with custom splash screen

                        <p>
                            In older versions of Chrome for Android, tapping on a homescreen icon for an app would often take up to 200ms (or multiple
                            seconds in slow sites) for the first frame of the document to be rendered to the screen.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            During this time, the user would see a white screen, decreasing the perceived performance of your site. Chrome 47 and above
                            <a href="#">support customising a splash screen</a> (based on a background_color, name and icons
                            from the Web App Manifest) used to color the screen until the browser is ready to paint something.
                            This makes your webapp feel a lot closer to “native”.

                        <p class="mt-4"><i>Note: Firefox for Android and Opera for Android also support the Web Application Manifest, Splash screen and an add to homescreen experience. On iOS, Safari still supports customising add to <a href="#">homescreen icons</a> and used to support a <a href="#">proprietary splashscreen</a> implementation, however this appears to have broken in iOS9. I’ve filed a feature request for Webkit to support the Web App Manifest so.. fingers crossed I guess.</i></p>
